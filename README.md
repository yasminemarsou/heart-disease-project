# heart-disease-project
In this data science and machine learning project, we will use various Python-based Libraries to analysis, preprocess the data and build a Machine learning model.

# General description:
This project aims to analyze, predict, and visualize heart disease risks using machine
learning. The workflow involves data preprocessing, feature selection, dimensionality
reduction (PCA), model training, evaluation, and deployment. Classification models like
Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and SVM will be used, alongside
K-Means and Hierarchical Clustering for unsupervised learning. Additionally, a Streamlit UI will be built for user interaction, deployed via streamlit community cloud, and the project will be hosted on GitHub.
# Objectives:
Perform Data Preprocessing & Cleaning (handle missing values, encoding, scaling).
  ● Apply Dimensionality Reduction (PCA) to retain essential features.
  ● Implement Feature Selection using statistical methods and ML-based techniques.
  ● Train Supervised Learning Models (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random
    Forest, SVM) for classification.
  ● Apply Unsupervised Learning (K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering) for pattern           discovery.
  ● Optimize Models using Hyperparameter Tuning (GridSearchCV,RandomizedSearchCV).
  ● Deploy a Streamlit UI for real-time user interaction. 
  ● Host the application using streamlit community cloud and upload the project to       GitHub for accessibility.
